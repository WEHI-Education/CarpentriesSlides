## Paper Writing

-   Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are
    writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve the *excellent*
    version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?

-   Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and
    comments they make to your paper? If you use LibreOffice Writer or
    Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the
    `Track Changes` option? Do you have a history of those changes?

## Places to Create Git Repositories

Along with tracking information about planets (the project we have
already created), Dracula would also like to track information about
moons. Despite Wolfman's concerns, Dracula creates a `moons` project
inside his `planets` project with the following sequence of commands:

``` bash
$ cd ~/Desktop   # return to Desktop directory
$ cd planets     # go into planets directory, which is already a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the planets directory
$ mkdir moons    # make a subdirectory planets/moons
$ cd moons       # go into moons subdirectory
$ git init       # make the moons subdirectory a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `moons` subdirectory, required
for tracking files stored in the `moons` subdirectory?

## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

Wolfman explains to Dracula how a nested repository is redundant and may
cause confusion down the road. Dracula would like to remove the nested
repository. How can Dracula undo his last `git init` in the `moons`
subdirectory?

## Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working
on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the
script and it no longer runs. She has spent \~ 1hr trying to fix it,
with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git!
Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of
her Python script called `data_cruncher.py`?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`

2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`

3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`

4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`

5.  Both 2 and 4
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating with colleagues on her Python script. She
realizes her last commit to the project's repository contained an error,
and wants to undo it. Jennifer wants to undo correctly so everyone in
the project's repository gets the correct change. The command
`git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a new commit that
reverses the erroneous commit.

The command `git revert` is different from `git checkout [commit ID]`
because `git checkout` returns the files not yet committed within the
local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert` reverses
changes committed to the local and project repositories.

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use
`git revert`, what is the missing command?

1.  `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`

2.  Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g.Â 0b1d055).

3.  `git revert [commit ID]`

4.  Type in the new commit message.

5.  Save and close

$ git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"
$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```

1.  ``` output
      Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
    ```

2.  ``` output
      Venus is beautiful and full of love
    ```

3.  ``` output
      Venus is beautiful and full of love
      Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base

## Checking Understanding of `git diff`

it? Why?

with the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you

## Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged
changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been
staged but not committed? Make a change to `mars.txt`, add that change
using `git add`, then use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your
change.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a
challenge to find the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from
several months ago.

Imagine the `planets` project has more than 50 files. You would like to
find a commit that modifies some specific text in `mars.txt`. When you
type `git log`, a very long list appeared. How can you narrow down the
search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific
file, e.g., `git diff mars.txt`. We can apply a similar idea here.

``` bash
$ git log mars.txt
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g.,
`update files`. How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a
different part of the history for you. Is it possible to combine both?
Let's try the following:

``` bash
$ git log --patch mars.txt
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both
commit messages and the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

``` bash
$ git log --patch HEAD~9 *.txt
```

## Log Files

You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form
`log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc. You want to keep them but you do not
want to track them through `git`.

1.  Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form
    `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.

2.  Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form
    `log_01`, etc.

3.  You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it
    to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.

4.  Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in
    your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude
    via `.gitignore`.
