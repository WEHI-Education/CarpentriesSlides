## Paper Writing

-   Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are
    writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve the *excellent*
    version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?

-   Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and
    comments they make to your paper? If you use LibreOffice Writer or
    Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the
    `Track Changes` option? Do you have a history of those changes?

# Setting Up Git

::: overview
## Objectives

-   Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer.
-   Understand the meaning of the `--global` configuration flag.
:::

::: overview
## Questions

-   How do I get set up to use Git?

# Creating a Repository

::: overview
## Objectives

-   Create a local Git repository.
-   Describe the purpose of the `.git` directory.
:::

::: overview
## Questions

-   Where does Git store information?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](fig/motivatingexample.png){alt="The main elements of the story: Dracula, Wolfman, the Mummy, Mars, Pluto and The Moon"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Places to Create Git Repositories

Along with tracking information about planets (the project we have
already created), Dracula would also like to track information about
moons. Despite Wolfman's concerns, Dracula creates a `moons` project
inside his `planets` project with the following sequence of commands:

``` bash
$ cd ~/Desktop   # return to Desktop directory
$ cd planets     # go into planets directory, which is already a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the planets directory
$ mkdir moons    # make a subdirectory planets/moons
$ cd moons       # go into moons subdirectory
$ git init       # make the moons subdirectory a Git repository
$ ls -a          # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `moons` subdirectory, required
for tracking files stored in the `moons` subdirectory?

## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

Wolfman explains to Dracula how a nested repository is redundant and may
cause confusion down the road. Dracula would like to go back to a single
git repository. How can Dracula undo his last `git init` in the `moons`
subdirectory?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Tracking Changes

::: overview
## Objectives

-   Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files.
-   Explain where information is stored at each stage of that cycle.
-   Distinguish between descriptive and non-descriptive commit messages.
:::

::: overview
## Questions

-   How do I record changes in Git?
-   How do I check the status of my version control repository?
-   How do I record notes about what changes I made and why?

![](fig/git-committing.svg){alt="A diagram showing two documents being separately staged using git add, before being combined into one commit using git commit"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
last commit made to `mars.txt`?

1.  "Changes"
2.  "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to
    mars.txt"
3.  "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Committing Changes to Git

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt` to my
local Git repository?

1.  ``` bash
       $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
    ```

2.  ``` bash
       $ git init myfile.txt
       $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
    ```

3.  ``` bash
       $ git add myfile.txt
       $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
    ```

4.  ``` bash
       $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
    ```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Committing Multiple Files

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want
to commit as a single snapshot.

1.  Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision to consider Venus
    as a base
2.  Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts about Venus
    as a base for you and your friends
3.  Add changes from both files to the staging area, and commit those
    changes.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## `bio` Repository

-   Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
-   Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`,
    commit your changes
-   Modify one line, add a fourth line
-   Display the differences between its updated state and its original
    state.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Exploring History

::: overview
## Objectives

-   Explain what the HEAD of a repository is and how to use it.
-   Identify and use Git commit numbers.
-   Compare various versions of tracked files.
-   Restore old versions of files.
:::

::: overview
## Questions

-   How can I identify old versions of files?
-   How do I review my changes?
-   How can I recover old versions of files?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](fig/git-checkout.svg){alt="A diagram showing how git checkout HEAD~1 can be used to restore the previous version of two files"}

## Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working
on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the
script and it no longer runs. She has spent \~ 1hr trying to fix it,
with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git!
Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of
her Python script called `data_cruncher.py`?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`

2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`

3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`

4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`

5.  Both 2 and 4
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating with colleagues on her Python script. She
realizes her last commit to the project's repository contained an error,
and wants to undo it. Jennifer wants to undo correctly so everyone in
the project's repository gets the correct change. The command
`git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a new commit that
reverses the erroneous commit.

The command `git revert` is different from `git checkout [commit ID]`
because `git checkout` returns the files not yet committed within the
local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert` reverses
changes committed to the local and project repositories.

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use
`git revert`, what is the missing command?

1.  `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`

2.  Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g.Â 0b1d055).

3.  `git revert [commit ID]`

4.  Type in the new commit message.

5.  Save and close
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in

``` bash
$ cd planets
$ echo "Venus is beautiful and full of love" > venus.txt
$ git add venus.txt
$ echo "Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base" >> venus.txt
$ git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"
$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```

1.  ``` output
      Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
    ```

2.  ``` output
      Venus is beautiful and full of love
    ```

3.  ``` output
      Venus is beautiful and full of love
      Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
    ```

4.  ``` output
      Error because you have changed venus.txt without committing the changes
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~9 mars.txt`. What do you predict
this command will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute
it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] mars.txt`, where \[ID\] is replaced
with the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you
think will happen, and what does happen?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged
changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been
staged but not committed? Make a change to `mars.txt`, add that change
using `git add`, then use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your
change.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a
challenge to find the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from
several months ago.

Imagine the `planets` project has more than 50 files. You would like to
find a commit that modifies some specific text in `mars.txt`. When you
type `git log`, a very long list appeared. How can you narrow down the
search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific
file, e.g., `git diff mars.txt`. We can apply a similar idea here.

``` bash
$ git log mars.txt
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g.,
`update files`. How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a
different part of the history for you. Is it possible to combine both?
Let's try the following:

``` bash
$ git log --patch mars.txt
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both
commit messages and the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

``` bash
$ git log --patch HEAD~9 *.txt
```

# Ignoring Things

::: overview
## Objectives

-   Configure Git to ignore specific files.
-   Explain why ignoring files can be useful.
:::

::: overview
## Questions

-   How can I tell Git to ignore files I don't want to track?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

``` bash
results/data
results/plots
```

How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.csv` files in your root directory except for
`final.csv`? Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator)
does
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested
Files exercise, but with a slightly different directory structure:

``` bash
results/data
results/images
results/plots
results/analysis
```

How would you ignore all of the contents in the results folder, but not
`results/data`?

Hint: think a bit about how you created an exception with the `!`
operator before.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Ignoring all data Files in a Directory

Assuming you have an empty .gitignore file, and given a directory
structure that looks like:

``` bash
results/data/position/gps/a.csv
results/data/position/gps/b.csv
results/data/position/gps/c.csv
results/data/position/gps/info.txt
results/plots
```

What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all
`.csv` files in `result/data/position/gps`? Do not ignore the
`info.txt`.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Ignoring all data Files in the repository

Let us assume you have many `.csv` files in different subdirectories of
your repository. For example, you might have:

``` bash
results/a.csv
data/experiment_1/b.csv
data/experiment_2/c.csv
data/experiment_2/variation_1/d.csv
```

How do you ignore all the `.csv` files, without explicitly listing the
names of the corresponding folders?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## The Order of Rules

Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

``` bash
*.csv
!*.csv
```

What will be the result?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: challenge
## Log Files

You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form
`log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc. You want to keep them but you do not
want to track them through `git`.

1.  Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form
    `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.

2.  Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form
    `log_01`, etc.

3.  You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it
    to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.

4.  Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in
    your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude
    via `.gitignore`.

::: challenge
## A Typical Work Session

You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is
tracked in a remote Git repository. During your work session, you take
the following actions, but not in this order:

-   *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file
    `numbers.txt`
-   *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
-   *Celebrate* your success with some fancy beverage(s)
-   *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
-   *Stage changes* to be committed
-   *Commit changes* to the local repository

In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances
of conflicts? Put the commands above in order in the *action* column of
the table below. When you have the order right, see if you can write the
corresponding commands in the *command* column. A few steps are
populated to get you started.

## How to Track Large Data or Image Files using Git?

Large data or image files such as `.md5` or `.psd` file types can be
tracked within a github repository using the [Git Large File
Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com) open source extension tool. This
tool automatically uploads large file contents to a remote server and
replaces the file with a text pointer within the github repository.

Try downloading and installing the Git Large File Storage extension
tool, then add tracking of a large file to your github repository. Ask a
colleague to clone your repository and describe what they see when they
access that large file.
